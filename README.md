### ðŸ“š Context

At one time or another, we've all wasted time trying to figure out when we coded this or that, or where we "stored" it... ðŸ˜« <br>
To avoid searching through numerous projects, I've created a library of animations, in CSS only, where I store those that seem important and easily reusable. <br>
I'm sharing this little project with you, because it's also thanks to the sharing of others that I've been able to enrich my knowledge and manipulate animations ðŸ˜ƒ. <br>

### Technologies
